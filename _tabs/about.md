**Wil** is a native of Ecuador who moved to Catalonia, Spain, when he was 10 years old.
His fascination with pure sciences, particularly mathematics and physics, began during his childhood.
At 17, following his completion of the "PAU" (the university entrance exam in Spain), he secured admission to pursue a physics degree in Barcelona.
Unfortunately, due to challenging financial circumstances within his family, he couldn't relocate from his residence in Girona.
Consequently, he opted to enroll in Computer Science at the same university.

Throughout his degree program,
he developed a strong passion for software automation,
artificial intelligence, functional programming,
and the intricacies of working within Linux environments.
Simultaneously,
he gained valuable hands-on experience by collaborating with local companies in Girona.
This practical exposure occurred alongside the completion of his degree.
Following this, he embarked on a journey to attain a master's degree in Data Science at the University of Girona.
This decision was underscored by his firm belief in the transformative potential of data-driven solutions,
which he views as the bedrock of the future.

Wil have thought functional and logical programming,
in University of Girona.
He also has been working as a Computer Scientist in the private sector focussing on analyzing data,
hecreate AI solution as well as automating infrastructure tasks.
He enjoy coming up with smart solutions for tough challenges.
