**Wil** is a native of Ecuador who moved to Catalonia, Spain, when he was 10 years old.
His fascination with pure sciences, particularly mathematics and physics, began during his childhood.
At 17, following his completion of the "PAU" (the university entrance exam in Spain), he secured admission to pursue a physics degree in Barcelona.
Unfortunately, due to challenging financial circumstances within his family, he couldn't relocate from his residence in Girona.
Consequently, he opted to enroll in Computer Science at the University of Girona.

Throughout his degree program,
he developed a strong passion for software automation,
artificial intelligence, functional programming
and the intricacies of working within Linux environments.
Simultaneously,
he gained valuable hands-on experience by collaborating with local companies in Girona.
This practical exposure occurred alongside the completion of his degree.
Following this, he embarked on a journey to attain a master's degree in Data Science in the same university.
This decision was underscored by his firm belief in the transformative potential of data-driven solutions,
which he views as the bedrock of the future.

Will has worked as an associate professor in the Computer Science program at the University of Girona.
He taught subjects related to functional and logical programming. Outside of teaching,
he also worked as a Computer Scientist in the private sector. There,
he concentrated on studying data,
creating AI solutions, and automating tasks related to computer systems.
